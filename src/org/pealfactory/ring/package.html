The ring package contains the basic classes representing rows and place notation,
and providing permutation services. Although fully-featured, performance and
code size are paramount in the design of these classes.
<p>
A {@link org.pealfactory.ring.PN} object is constructed using a String containing
human-readable place notation in any one of a number of standard formats.
It parses the notation on construction, and can then provide access to each
individual change, as well as a (normally accurate) assessment of the number of
bells the notation applies to.
Other statistical properties are also provided, such as whether the notational is
symmetrical, right-place, etc.
<p>
Two Row classes are provided: one mutable and one immutable. They provide similar
services, including analysis of properties such as tenors-together, and permutation by
place notation and arbitrary row. Here is some example code showing how to use
the Row and PN classes to generate every row in the first lead of a method:
<pre>
		PN pn = new PN("&-18-14, +12");
		Row r = new Row(pn.guessNBells());
		for (int i=0; i&lt;pn.getLength(); i++)
		{
			r.applyPN(pn.getChange(i));
			if (r.equals(kROUNDS))
				break;
		}
</pre>
<p>
And here is the equivalent code using ImmutableRow:
<pre>
		PN pn = new PN("&-18-14, +12");
		ImmutableRow row = new ImmutableRow(pn.guessNBells());
		for (int i=0; i&lt;pn.getLength(); i++)
		{
			row = row.change(pn.getChange(i));
			if (row.isRounds())
				break;
		}
</pre>
